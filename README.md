# hello-world
I am a information technology professional who has over three decades of experience working in data center operations, deskside support, and server administration. I started working I.T. full-time in the 90s, progressed through a career in Corporate America before starting my own I.T. Business that I currently own and operate.
My first programming language I learned was BASIC on the Commodore 64. Now that most servers room boast virtual servers rather than baremetal, I've shifted my focus from customer service and support to programming applications to run on those virtual servers and websites.
