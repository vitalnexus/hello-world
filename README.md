# hello-world
I am a information technology professional who has over three decades of experience working in data center operations, deskside support, and server administration. I started working I.T. full-time in the 90s, progressed through a career in Corporate America before starting my own I.T. Business that I currently own and operate.
My first programming language I learned was BASIC on the Commodore 64. Coming to GitHub so I can update/publish some work I've done in the past, some of which dates back to 1995.
