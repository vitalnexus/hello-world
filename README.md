# hello-world
I am a information technology professional who has over two decades of experience working with servers, desktops and applications. I got into I.T. full-time in the 90s.
My first programming language I learned was BASIC on the Commodore 64. Coming to GitHub so I can update/publish some work I've done in the past, some of which dates back to 1995.
